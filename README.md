### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
It took me a few days (~4) to write the code for this project. I just completed my third week of Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The main goal of this project was to fine tune our understanding of the interactions between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were also challeneged with building out our own HTML and CSS.

 The tech involved includes: Google Chrome (internet browser), GitHub (cloud repository), and VS Code (code editor).

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1. Wins:
	1. I was able to complete three of the "choose your own adventure" iterations. I'm particuarly proud of this as I made it a point thoughout this project to push myself and not settle after completeing one of the CYOAs. 
	2. I view the completion of the project as a whole to be a huge win. Everything about coding was new to me a few months ago so the fact that I was able to build out a fully functioning application from scratch is incredible.
2. Challenges:
    1. My biggest challenge in this project was trying to match the comps. I've come to realize that I can be a bit of a perfectionist so I found myself making the tiniest adjustments in CSS, checking the index.html, and repeating until I felt I was looking at the exact same image. In hindsight, I likely spent too much time doing that and could have built out additional CYOAs if I had moved on sooner.
